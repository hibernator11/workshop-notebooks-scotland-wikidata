## Authors

- Gustavo Candela, University of Alicante
- Milena Dobreva, University of Strathclyde

Note that in previous years, another project was used as training material: https://github.com/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-scotland

## Examples provided
- Hello World - [HelloWorld.ipynb](notebooks/HelloWorld.ipynb)
- Authors from the National Library of France - [wikidata-bnf-example.ipynb](notebooks/wikidata-bnf-example.ipynb)
- Authors related to the movement Spanish Golden Age from the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes - [wikidata-bnf-example.ipynb](notebooks/wikidata-bvmc-example.ipynb)
- Artists from Museo el Prado - [wikidata-bnf-example.ipynb](notebooks/wikidata-prado-example.ipynb)

All of them retrieve the data using a SPARQL query and store the data in a JSON file.

### Tasks

1. Review the notebooks provided. Check how the SPARQL queries can be executed and the data retrieved. You can also try using https://query.wikidata.org
2. Using the code provided, would you be able to create a new notebook and retrieve 100 artworks from El Prado? Please, note that you will have to use the property wdt:P8905.
3. Explore new SPARQL queries
4. Try to create some notes as a documentation of the process

### Acknowledgments
This work was possible thanks to many researchers, labbers, librarians and initiatives from around the world. First of all, I would like to thank Milena Dobreva for inviting me to give this workshop. This work would not have been possible without the help and inspiration of the [International GLAM Labs Community](glamlabs.io), the [Collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) initiative, the [National Library of Scotland](https://data.nls.uk/), the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/), [DARIAH-EU](https://www.dariah.eu/) and [Europeana Research](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/research).
